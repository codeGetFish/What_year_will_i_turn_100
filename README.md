# What_year_will_i_turn_100
This is my first repository on github. A simple project for beginners.
This is a simple project for learning to code in Python, it takes 3 inputs in order to work out what the year will be when you turn 100.
There is no exception handling which means it is very easy to break this code by putting in unexpected values.
I will expand on this project to make it more robust in future repositories.
